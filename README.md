# rasp_messenger
messenger to recieve commands from client
This is the flask server which will be ran from the raspberry PI so that it can receive messages from the clients device.
The client will connect to the website by being on the same network as the raspberry PI.
Then the client will send messages which will then be used by raspberry PI to perform remote tasks when voice control is not possible.

Made using Flask in the backend.
